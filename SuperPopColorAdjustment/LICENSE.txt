--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Definitions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"Licensor" – SuperBeasts.AI

"Model" – the Super Pop Color Adjustment neural network weights (all versions) and
any derived/finetuned weight files based on them, in any format (.onnx, .safetensors,
.ckpt,.pt, etc.).

"Outputs" – media produced by running the Model (images, video frames, etc.).

"Internal Use" – use by you, your employees, and contractors working for you under
confidentiality (NDA); includes work you deliver to paying clients when you run the Model.

"Public Hosted Service" – any website, SaaS platform, cloud API, mobile/web app, plug‑in,
batch service, or other network-accessible system that lets unaffiliated external users
submit content and receive processed results powered (in whole or part) by the Model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What You Can Do (No Permission Needed)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You may download, run, modify, convert, and finetune the Model for:

 • Personal projects;
 • Commercial work done by you (studio, freelance, in‑house for clients);
 • Research, education, portfolio demos, livestreams, and content creation;
 • Private render farms / automation that YOU control (including cloud instances)
   so long as external users do not directly access the Model.

You may deliver corrected images/videos (Outputs) to clients. Rights in the content you
process remain yours / your clients’—this License does not grant rights to third‑party
input material.

No attribution required (credit appreciated). Do not misrepresent origin (Section 3C).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. What Needs Permission
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You must obtain written permission (commercial license) from Licensor before you:

(A) Offer the Model as a **Public Hosted Service** (paid or free), including
    online apps, APIs, or cloud tools where outside users upload images and
    receive Model‑processed results.

(B) Redistribute, bundle, embed, or ship the Model weights outside your organization,
    including in downloadable products, model packs, training bundles, checkpoints,
    or installer images.

(C) Market or brand the Model (or a derivative) as your own colour correction
    technology or imply that you trained the original Model.

4. Responsible Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You agree not to use the Model or Outputs for:
 • Illegal activity, or material that infringes others’ rights (copyright, privacy, etc.);
 • Targeted harassment, hate, or abuse of protected groups;
 • Non‑consensual sexual or exploitative content;
 • Deceptive deepfakes presented as real people without disclosure.

Keep it legal. Respect people.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. No Warranty
--------------------------------------------------------------------
THE MODEL IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. PERFORMANCE MAY VARY
BY IMAGE TYPE, RESOLUTION, PLATFORM, OR WORKFLOW.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------------------------------------------------
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
ARISING FROM USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE MODEL OR OUTPUTS.
